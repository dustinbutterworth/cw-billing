This sets up a Cloudwatch Billing alarm that will alert you if you pass $10 within 6 hrs. 

Until I finish getting everything parameterized, you'll have to enter your email
in the cw-billing.yml file in place of email@email.com.

TODO: 
1.) Create more fleshed out Readme
2.) Parameterize everything to make it easier to create/delete stacks, specify email/profiles, etc...
